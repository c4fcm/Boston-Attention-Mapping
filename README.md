Mapping the Globe
=========

Mapping the Globe is a set of interactive visualizations and maps that help us understand where the Boston Globe directs its attention. Media attention matters â€“ in quantity and quality. It helps determine what we talk about as a public and how we talk about it. Mapping the Globe tracks where the paper's attention goes and what that attention looks like across different regional geographies in combination with diverse data sets like population, crime and income.
